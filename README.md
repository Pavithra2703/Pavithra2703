## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, my name is Pavithra R. I am a final-year student at the College of Engineering, Trivandrum, pursuing my degree in  Computer Science and Engineering.

I have a strong interest in  web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and have worked on projects such as Traffic sign recognition system using OpenCV and TensorFlow,  a hotel management system etc.

I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and am always eager to learn and take on new challenges. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, or reading.
